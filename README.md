## 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption Decryption Tool 🔐
## 📜 What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet.

## 🎨 Features:
✅ GUI built with Tkinter

✅ Encrypt and decrypt text

✅ Supports upper & lower case letters

✅ Ignores non-alphabetic characters (punctuation, spaces, etc.)

✅ User-defined shift value

## 📋 How to Use:

1.Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.

2.Enter a shift value (e.g., 2).

3.Choose either Encrypt or Decrypt.

4.View the result in the output field.
